# Project Rules

## Canvas Components
- **Never set fixed pixel dimensions** on `<canvas>` elements via inline `style={{ width: N, height: N }}`. Canvas must always use `style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%" }}` and derive actual dimensions from the parent container via `canvas.clientWidth` / `canvas.clientHeight` in the draw loop.
- **Always guard the draw loop** against 0-dimension canvases: if `clientWidth` or `clientHeight` is 0, skip the frame and schedule the next `requestAnimationFrame`. This prevents black-box rendering when the canvas hasn't been laid out yet.
- The parent container is responsible for sizing (e.g., `width: min(90vw, 600px)`), not the canvas itself.

## Layout Alignment
- **Side-by-side text and media align at the top.** In any two-column layout (text beside an image, video, card, or second text block), the top of the media lines up with the top of the text block, which is usually the eyebrow. Use `items-start` on the grid/flex row, never `items-center` or `items-end`, for these pairs. Applies site-wide, studios and rovmusic.

## .next Cache
- Run `rimraf .next` before `next dev` (already configured in package.json `"dev"` script). If you see "Cannot find module './XXXX.js'" errors, delete `.next` and restart.

## Team Data
- Team member images must use `.webp` format only (not `.png`). Images live in `public/teammembers/`.
- Team member descriptions (specialties) must be written in **first person** ("I design..." not "Designs...").

## Blog Page Design Standard
All custom blog `page.tsx` files must match the design system defined in `.claude/blog-design-standard.md`.
Canonical reference: `app/blog/restaurant-atlanta/page.tsx`.

**The non-negotiables:**
- Colors: cream `#FFF4E3` bg, dark espresso `#3B2114`, rust `#90422C`, orange `#EA9A61`
- Fonts: Norwige (headings) / Inter (body) / Neue Montreal (labels only)
- Structure: Hero → Stats Row → Main Content → FAQ Accordion → Author Card → CTA
- Hero H1: solid white, not gradient
- Author pill in hero: beige background, dark text
- CTA: beige background, dark text — never dark/gradient CTA background
- Logo always links to `/`
- FAQ: cream background, Norwige bold questions, chevron accordion
