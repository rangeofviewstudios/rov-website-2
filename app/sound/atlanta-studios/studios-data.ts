// STRATEGY NOTE: the Atlanta studio SERP is made of directories and listicles
// (Yelp, SoundBetter, Peerspace, Tagvenue, roomforsound, atlantahits), not
// studio homepages. The way into a listicle SERP is to be the better listicle,
// which means describing competitors fairly and sending some readers to them.
//
// ACCURACY RULES, non-negotiable, because these are real businesses:
//   1. Only facts published on each studio's own site, checked 2026-09-18.
//   2. No invented rates. None of them publish rates; say exactly that.
//   3. No disparagement. The comparison is "what is it for", not "who is worse".
//   4. Re-check before any major update and move VERIFIED_ON.
//
// If a studio publishes rates later, add them with the source. Do not estimate.

        question: "Do you need a room, or do you need an engineer?",
        answer:
            "If you already have usable takes, you need mixing, not studio time, and you can send stems to anyone anywhere. Paying for a live room you are not using is the most common way first-time budgets disappear.",

    {
        question: "Are you tracking alone or as a band?",
        answer:
            "A solo vocalist needs a good booth and a good engineer. A band playing together needs a live room big enough to do it, which is a much smaller list of studios and a different price bracket.",

            "Every studio on this page is a real, working room, and none of them publish rates except us. Quote-only is normal in this industry and is not a red flag on its own.

        question: "How much does it cost to mix and master a song in Atlanta?",
        answer:
            "It varies widely and most engineers quote per project. Our published rate is $50 for a first song, $100 for a single song after that, and down to $58 a song on a 12-song pack. A dedicated mastering specialist working on major-label records will be substantially more.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why do so few Atlanta studios list their prices?",
        answer:
            "Quote-based pricing is the industry norm, partly because sessions genuinely vary and partly because it keeps negotiating room. It is not dishonest. It does make it hard for a first-time artist to plan a budget, which is why we publish ours.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to record in Atlanta to work with an Atlanta engineer?",
        answer:
            "No. Mixing and mastering are remote by default and most work arrives as stems from anywhere. Being in Atlanta matters when you need the room itself, which means tracking, or when you want the arrangement conversation to happen in person.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is a more expensive studio a better studio?",
        answer:
            "It is usually a bigger one. Rate mostly reflects the room, the console, and the demand for the engineer's time. A large SSL tracking room is genuinely worth it for a full band with a producer, and genuinely wasted on one vocalist over a beat.",
