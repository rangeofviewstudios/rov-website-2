// SPACE — VUE'S GUIDE SCRIPT
//
// Everything Vue says from the bubble, keyed by beat. Same voice as the
// magazine close: first person, plain, warm, a little above it all. Short,
// because the bubble is small and the pilot is flying. `{label}` and
// `{route}` are filled in by the guide.
//
// The quiz is the /ctrla/start quiz, word for word, so a profile answered
// in the cockpit means exactly what one answered on the page means.
