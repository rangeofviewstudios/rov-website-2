// SPACE — THE MAP
//
// The single registry that runs the whole universe. Every body in the scene,
// every chip in the HUD, every pin on the 2D star map, and every dock panel
// renders from this array. Growing the universe is editing this list.
//
// Rules:
//   - Every stop links to a REAL page. Nothing lives only in the game.
//   - Positions are computed from orbit params at runtime, so the system is
//     always gently moving and never overlaps at rest. Orbit speeds are kept
//     slow enough that the static star map stays honest for a session.
//   - `look.palette` drives the procedural material: [deep, mid, glow].
